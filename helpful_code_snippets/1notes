linked lists:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
singly/doubly linked lists: includes structure, traversal, insertion, deletion, and time complexity analysis

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct SinglyListNode {
    int val; //------------------------>value associated with the node

    SinglyListNode *next;//------------>pointer to the next node

    SinglyListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};


// Addition of a value in the linked list
1) initialize a new node with some value
2) link the next field of the current node with prev of next
3) link the prev field of the current node with next of prev


// for adding a new node at the beginning/a new head
Initialize a new node cur;
Link the new node to our original head node head.
Assign cur to head. 

****important****
Node* head = n;
    while (n != NULL) { 
        cout << n->data << " "; 
        n = n->next; 
    } 
    n=head;//resetting linked list to head
